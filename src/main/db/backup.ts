 * plain copy taken mid-write can land torn or miss committed data sitting in the
 * `-wal`. VACUUM INTO takes a read transaction, so it is safe while the app is
 * running, and it writes a single compacted file with no sidecars to keep
 * together.
 *
 * The result is an ordinary SQLite database: restoring is copying it back over
 * `xrncal.sqlite` with the app closed.
